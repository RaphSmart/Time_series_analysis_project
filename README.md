This is a project on Anomalies Detection. This project aim at detecting anomalies in data. 


**Dataset**: we have used the nyc_taxi.csv "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/new-york-taxi" dataset from kaggle. 


The New York City Taxi dataset contains just two columns, the timestamp and values. The values represent the frequencies of taxis during the particular timestamp dated from 2014-2015.


We have used sklearn, pandas, matplotlib, plotly libraries to visualize data with anomalies.


The detected anomalies percentage was 0.61%.
