This is a project on Time series analysis. This project aim at detecting anomalies in data. 
we have used the nyc_taxi.csv "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/new-york-taxi" dataset from kaggle. 
The New York City Taxi dataset contains just two columns, the timestamp and values(frequency). Dated from 2014-2015 to detect the anomalies of New York taxi frequency. we have used sklearn, pandas libraries etc to visualize data with anomalies.
The anomalies percentage detected was 0.6163328197226503.
